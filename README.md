A web app that let users randomly shuffle the letters of a word in to a random order.

If a sentence, paragraph or any longer text is entered it will be shuffled one word at a time.

Currently allows the English alphabet, numbers, question marks, exclamation marks and dots [?!.]. These characters will always be at the end of a word.

Any word containing a capital letter will have the first letter of the shuffled word capitalized. If a word that's been entered was all capital letters, the shuffled word will also be capitalized.
